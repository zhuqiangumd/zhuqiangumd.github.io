Abstract
---------
Heart rate from videos was first demonstrated feasible in 2008, and since then most work has been focusing on still/rest cases or those with relatively small body motions. In contrast, less work has been on large motion scenarios such as fitness exercises. To extract pulse rate from video with siginificantIn this work, we propose a heart-rate monitoring method for fitness exercise videos. We focus on designing a highly precise motion compensation scheme with the help of the optical flow, and use motion in- formation as a cue to adaptively remove ambiguous frequency components for improving the heart rates estimates. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve highly precise estimation with an average error of 1.1 beats per minute (BPM) or 0.58% in relative error.
