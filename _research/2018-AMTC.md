Abstract
---------
Many information forensic challenges involving small signals often boil down to the problem of frequency extraction, which can be nontrivial as the signal might be severely corrupted by co-existing noise and interference. <img style="float: right;" src="http://zhuqiangumd.github.io/images/AMTC_sysdiag.png" width="700"> To facilitate the authentication and the decision-making process for these forensic applications, we develop a robust frequency tracking approach to address the problem of tracking one or more subtle frequency components in very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We treat the signalâ€™s time-frequency representation as a visual cue and identify all frequency traces with dominating energy. Inspired by the seam carving algorithm for content-based aspect ratio adaptation of images, we propose the Adaptive Multi-Trace Carving (AMTC) algorithm for tracking multiple frequency traces in quasi-realtime through iterative dynamic programming and adaptive trace compensation. Extensive experiments using both synthesis and real-world forensic data reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under low SNR conditions and can be implemented in near real-time settings. The success of this work may empower the development of new frequency-based forensic technologies and other small signal applications.
